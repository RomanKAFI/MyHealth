# MyHealth â€” Virtual Medical Cabinet

Java-based application for managing personal health records, appointments, and treatment tracking.  
Built as a practice project to demonstrate full-stack development concepts and modular design.

---

## ðŸš€ Overview
MyHealth is a prototype of an eHealth system.  
It simulates how patients can track their medical information, manage appointments, and view basic analytics.  

Key focuses:
- OOP and modular design in Java
- Database-driven application
- Patient records & appointments
- Treatment tracking with a "To-Do" style module
- Future expansion to REST API + GUI

---

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Java 17 (OOP, Collections, Streams)  
- **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL (planned)  
- **UI:** CLI (console), JavaFX (planned)  
- **Practices:** OOP, data persistence, error handling, unit testing  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Features
- Create / update patient profiles  
- Store medical history (diagnoses, prescriptions)  
- Appointment scheduling  
- Treatment tracking (medications, measurements, tasks)  
- Export simple reports (planned)  
- Console-based UI (Java)  
- Planned: GUI with JavaFX
